/**
 * <p>Provides classes and methods to work with dates and durations.
 * These classes are immutable (and therefore thread-safe) apart from {@link org.apache.commons.lang3.time.StopWatch}.</p>
 *
 * <p>The time package contains some basic utilities for manipulating time (a delorean, police box and grandfather clock?).
 * These include a {@link org.apache.commons.lang3.time.StopWatch} for simple performance measurements and an optimised {@link org.apache.commons.lang3.time.FastDateFormat} class.</p>
 *
 * <p>New in Lang 2.1 is the {@link org.apache.commons.lang3.time.DurationFormatUtils} class, which provides various methods for formatting durations.</p>
